# Logistic-Reression
Here you will see the predition of the target variable which is Binary type.
I have used a dataset of creditrisk, Churn and titanic to actually showcase
the real time sceario and how to handle it with the Logistic Regression algorithm

# 1.CreditRisk Dataset


About the Dataset ----

Here in this data we have the all necessary x-factor which we need to build the model.
for more just refer to the Creditrisk CSV file where you will get idea of the variables.
Here the Target variable is Loan Status.

Aim of the model --

Problem statement bank want to build predictive model 
which it can use for approval / rejection of loan.

Conclusion --

Here we have analyzed the data and pre-processed the data, Trained and build the model using the
Logistic Regression and also to know loan default and their proality we used Logistic regression.
we used precision, Recall, F1, and AUROC to evalvate the performance of the models at predicting
class labels. we can see the demo of how ML can be applied to the world in credit risk management.

# 2.Churn

About the Dataset ----

Will recommend to go through the CSV file to get Idea about the dataset

NOTE -- To practice the Logistic regression 

Just to pratice took the dataset for more just go through the python file

# 3.Titanic Dataset --

Here also same thing as churn dataset

About the Dataset ----

Will recommend to go through the CSV file to get Idea about the dataset

NOTE -- To practice the Logistic regression

Just to pratice took the dataset for more just go through the python file


# Just don't campare model for out performing as I am performing only one algorithm on this dataset. As we know algorithm varies according to the scenario or problem Statement of the Business.
